##TROUBLESHOOTING

Does your ETHlargement not work as expected? You're likely running an older memory revision. Here at OhGodACompany, we believe in promotiong a healthy mining lifestyle - that's why we've got a solution for our senior users, too!

With the use of --revA, you can specify which device should be fed our senior solution. If, for example, GPU 0, 3 and 4 aren't the young studs you thought they were, feed them with the following commands:

Windows: OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4
Powershell: .\OhGodAnETHlargementPill.exe --revA 0,3,4
Linux: ./OhGodAnETHlargementPill --revA 0,3,4

Be sure to leave ETHlargement running in the background, so your NVIDIA noodle can *aldente*.
